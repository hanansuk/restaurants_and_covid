## Vacations and Vaccinations, Summer 2021. How COVID Response Impacted Restaurants in Summer of 2021.

### Saurav Bhomick, Hanan Sukenik, Katy Scott

Federal, state, and local governments have all struggled to navigate the policy imperatives associated with
public safety and economic hardship throughout periods of high infection and periods of recovery in the
COVID19 pandemic. The variety of policy decisions made throughout the United States on measures like
stay-at-home orders, mask mandates, travel restrictions, and vaccination distribution present an opportunity
to examine positive and negative impacts of those choices.
To understand COVID19 impacts on our selected tourism industry: restaurants, we asked the following
research questions: 
1. Was restaurant attendance in the US in June of 2021 higher in states which had more
aggressive responses to COVID19? 
2. How did pandemic policy choices and vaccine distribution from 2020 and early 2021 impact restaurant attendance in June 2021?

Through this project, we will:

- Describe the reaseach questions and the data
- Explore the datasets
- Perform the needed data wrangling and manipulation
- Model and visualize the data
- Fit several linear models to explore causal relationships between policies and restaurant attendance

The project includes several files:
